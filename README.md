Despite all the successful stories behind the events; to-date, the competitions are still being judging
manually using paper-and-pen during the exhibition, regardless the judging process is critically
important to ensure the fair and unbiased judging. Meantime, it is important for the organizer to get the
results of accurate calculation for the overall marks from selected juries who are the experts appointed
from different sectors i.e. education, industries, government agencies, private agencies, etc. Recently,
the organizer used the online forms that allow the panels of juries for group of participated schools to
nominate and enter their marks for six (6) criteria as follow:
1. Knowledge (10 marks)
2. School structure & education (30 marks)
3. Quality & quantity of green efforts (30 marks)
4. Involvement (30 marks)
Prepared by NI Semester 2, 2020/2021
5. Impact (20 marks)
6. Future potential (20 marks)
[Refer to: Example of Judging forms]<br> 

Due to the current pandemic COVID-19, the RCE Iskandar Sustainable and Low Carbon Schools
Exhibition 2020 is conducted which the best 30 schools in Johor are invited to the online exhibition.
The schools should prepare (i) an E-Poster, (ii) a Video presentation and (iii) other related exhibition
materials to be presented at the exhibition (Refer to: Rules & Regulation RCESLC 2020 document).
All the three materials should be manually submitted and uploaded to the online cloud storage set by
the organizers [https://tinyurl.com/rceiskandar2020]. The participated schools should rely only to the
updated announcement from the social media for latest information [Refer:
https://www.facebook.com/sustainablerceiskandar/] The manual submissions from all the participated
are not well-organized which results to human errors, incomplete submission materials, no proof or
evidence ticket as well as no notification send as alert to both organizer and participants. Having
aforementioned difficulties, the organizer of RCE Iskandar Sustainable and Low Carbon Schools
Exhibition is planning to develop an automated system that allows the participant to systematically
submit the online exhibition materials. Also, the organizer aims to efficiently manage all the events
before/during/after exhibition including the judging process by the juries. <br> <br>
